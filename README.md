# Bike Rental Demand Prediction Project

## Problem Statement
Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing bike rental operations and ensuring efficient resource management. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict bike rental demand using both hourly and daily datasets. The goal is to enable better operational planning and meet fluctuating rental demands effectively.

## Dataset Description
- **Datasets Used**:
  - **hour.csv**: Contains hourly data of bike rentals, including detailed features such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and windspeed.
  - **day.csv**: Contains daily aggregated data of bike rentals.

- **Key Attributes from Hourly Dataset (used for model training)**:
  - **instant**: Record index.
  - **dteday**: Date of the record.
  - **season**: Season (1: spring, 2: summer, 3: fall, 4: winter).
  - **yr**: Year (0: 2011, 1: 2012).
  - **mnth**: Month (1 to 12).
  - **hr**: Hour of the day (0 to 23).
  - **weekday**: Day of the week.
  - **weathersit**: Weather situation (1: Clear, 2: Mist, 3: Light Snow/Rain, 4: Heavy Rain/Snow).
  - **temp**: Normalized temperature.
  - **atemp**: Normalized feeling temperature.
  - **hum**: Normalized humidity.
  - **windspeed**: Normalized wind speed.
  - **cnt**: Count of total bike rentals (target variable).

## Key Insights
- **Temporal Trends**: Significant variations in bike rentals observed across different seasons, months, and hours of the day.
- **Weather Influence**: Weather conditions, temperature, and humidity notably affect rental counts.
- **Peak Hours**: Higher rental activity noted during commuting hours (morning and evening).
- **Feature Correlation**: Temperature and seasonality showed a strong correlation with rental demand.

## Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and ensured dataset consistency.
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical formats where necessary.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted relevant features from the hourly dataset to enhance model performance.
   - Created derived features like 'peak hours' and 'weekend indicator.'

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized rental patterns across different timeframes and weather conditions.
   - Conducted correlation analysis to identify influential features.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented multiple regression models, including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
     - XGBoost Regressor
   - Applied hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using metrics like **R-squared**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
   
6. **Model Comparison Report**:
   - A comprehensive comparison was conducted to determine the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
   - The model with the highest R-squared value and lowest error metrics was identified as the most effective for predicting bike rental demand.

## Conclusion
- The developed model effectively captures the trends and patterns influencing bike rental demand.
- Temporal factors like season and hour of the day, along with weather conditions, were identified as significant contributors to rental counts.
- Incorporating continuous data monitoring and additional real-time features could further enhance predictive accuracy.
